    This simulation model simulates the data flow through the signmal procssing path
	using the data files generated by the Matlab simulation model

	This Verilog code is property of University of Porto
	Its utilization beyond the scope of the course Digital Systems Design
	(Projeto de Sistemas Digitais) of the Integrated Master in Electrical 
	and Computer Engineering requires explicit authorization from the author.
